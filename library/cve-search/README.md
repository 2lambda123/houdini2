## Description
cve-search is a tool to import CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and
CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) into a MongoDB to facilitate search
and processing of CVEs.

The main objective of the software is to avoid doing direct and public lookups
into the public CVE databases. Local lookups are usually faster and you can
limit your sensitive queries via the Internet.
