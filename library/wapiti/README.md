## Description

**Wapiti** works as a "black-box" vulnerability scanner, that means it won't study the source code of web applications but will work like a fuzzer, scanning the pages of the deployed web application, extracting links and forms and attacking the scripts, sending payloads and looking for error messages, special strings or abnormal behaviors.
