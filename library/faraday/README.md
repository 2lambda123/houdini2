## Description

**Faraday** introduces a new concept - IPE (Integrated Penetration-Test Environment) a multiuser Penetration test IDE. Designed for distributing, indexing, and analyzing the data generated during a security audit.

Faraday was made to let you take advantage of the available tools in the community in a truly multiuser way.

Faraday crunches the data you load into different visualizations that are useful to managers and pentesters alike.
