## Web App
To use HOUDINI, click the link below: 
- https://houdini.secsi.io

## Add a tool
To add a new tool you have to:
- Add it to the configuration (*webapp/src/config/tools.ts*)
- Add a **Markdown** file in the tools directory (*tools/*)
You may do it manually or you may use the **bootstrap** command:
```
yarn run bootstrap
```

This command automatically copies a template Markdown in the tools directory and adds the **JavaScript Object** in the config file.

## Development
This section provides a set of commands to run the application locally. 

PLEASE use **yarn** over **npm**

### Setup
This is a **React** based application. Before running it you have to install all the needed packages with the following command:
```
yarn install && cd ./webapp && yarn install
```

### Run
To execute the app locally you have to run:
```
yarn start
```

### Build
To build the app you have to run:
```
yarn run build
```

## Roadmap
Here is the current roadmap:
- [ ] Responsive Design
