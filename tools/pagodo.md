## Description
pagodo automates Google searching for potentially vulnerable web pages and applications on the Internet. It replaces manually performing Google dork searches with a web GUI browser.

There are 2 parts. The first is ghdb_scraper.py that retrieves the latest Google dorks and the second portion is pagodo.py that leverages the information gathered by ghdb_scraper.py.
