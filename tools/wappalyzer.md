## Description

**[Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com) identifies technologies on websites, such as CMS, web frameworks, ecommerce platforms, JavaScript libraries, analytics tools and [more](https://www.wappalyzer.com/technologies).**

If you don't have time to configure, host, debug and maintain your own infrastructure to analyse websites at scale, we offer a SaaS solution that has all the same capabilities and a lot more. Our [apps](https://www.wappalyzer.com/apps/) and [APIs](https://www.wappalyzer.com/api/) not only reveal the technology stack a website uses but also company and contact details, social media profiles, keywords and metadata.
