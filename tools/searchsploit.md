## Description

searchsploit is a command line search tool for Exploit-DB that also allows you to take a copy of Exploit Database with you, everywhere you go.

**This version only only allow to search exploit**, so you will **NOT** have _the power to perform detailed off-line searches through your locally checked-out copy of the repository_.
